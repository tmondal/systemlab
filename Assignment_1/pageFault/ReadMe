										Page Fault Count

Steps followed:

1. Using dd command a file is created.
2. Then freed pagecache, dentries and inodes (flushing cache) using system command
3. Then opened the created file using open() function which gives a file_descriptor through which we can access the file content.
4. We use fstat() functon to get the file size pointed by file_descriptor so that we can bring the file from secondary memory to virtual address space of current process using mmap() function which might cause page fault.
5. Finally we get resource usage of the calling process by using getrusage() function by putting RUSAGE_SELF as argument and get pagefault.
