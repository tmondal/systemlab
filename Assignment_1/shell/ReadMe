											Custom Shell

Program flow: 

	1. Getting username using getenv("USER") and printing full path to current directory as ubuntu shows.
	2. Then taken user command and parsed the command and processed three types of command
		a) Builtin command
		b) Simple command without redirection
		c) Command with redirection both single (>) and double (>>)
	3. cd implemented with system function chdir("folder name").
	4. mkdir implemented with system function mkdir("folder name",mode).
	5. cat implementation
		a)cat [No argument]
			-Taking input from stdin and printing on stdout
		b) cat <filename>
			-Taking each character from file "filename" and printing on stdout
		c) cat <filename1><filename2>...<filename9>
			-Taking characters from each file one by one and printing on stdout
		d) cat [>] <filename>
			-Opening file named "filename" as write only and duplicating fd of filename to stdout(1)
			- Thus what ever we write on terminal also goes to <filename> file.
		e) cat [>>] <filename>
			-Similar to previous except we open "filename" file as appendable
		f) cat <filename1> [>] <filename2>
			-Taking input from filename1 and puting to filename2 
		g) cat <filename1> [>>] <filename2>
			-Similar to previous but data will be appended in filename2
	6. top implementation
		- /proc directory oppened
		- scanned entire directory and opened each folder with interger name and read status file from that folder and printed on the screen
		- meminfo file opened and printed on screen
